## Rate Limiting

Configure rate limits per webhook to prevent API abuse:
- **0 seconds**: No rate limiting (immediate sending)
- **1-999 seconds**: Webhooks will be queued and sent at the specified interval
- **Queue notifications**: Get real-time updates when webhooks are queued
- **Smart queueing**: Only items that are actually delayed will show queue notifications

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **manifest.json**: Chrome extension manifest (Manifest V3)
- **background.js**: Service worker handling context menus, webhook management, and queue processing
- **popup.html/popup.js**: Modern tabbed UI for webhook registration and settings management
- **modal.html/modal.js**: Additional modal that is shown where there are additional details to attach
- **Chrome Storage**: Local storage for webhook persistence and settings

### Queue System
- **Independent queues** per webhook URL with configurable rate limits
- **Asynchronous processing** with setTimeout-based scheduling
- **Memory-efficient** cleanup of completed notifications
- **Persistent storage** integration for queue state management
